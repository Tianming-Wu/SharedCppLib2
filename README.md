#SHARED CPP Library 2 (SharedCppLib2)

Author: Tianming [github](https://github.com/Tianming-Wu)

This is free software with NO ABSOLUTE WARRENTY. Some of the Modules
may be incomplete.

You may use this library for personal or commercial usage. You don't
have to mention the usage of this library in your README or about,
but if you do so I will appreciate.



This is a series of useful cpp classes for multiple purposes.

- `ansiio` Simplifies the using of ANSI output features, including
  colors, url, cursor, å’Œ etc.
- `stringlist`
- `Base64` Base64 encode/decode
- `std::byteArray`
- `sha256` for encryption (incomplete).
